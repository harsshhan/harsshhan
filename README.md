👋 Hi there! I'm Harshan!

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in AI and Machine Learning at SRM University.

💡 My interests lie in Flutter development and vision-related machine learning projects. I love exploring how technology can improve our daily lives and solve real-world problems.

📱 I’ve developed a to-do app using Flutter, which includes Google sign-in and Firebase Firestore integration for task management.

🛠️ I have a solid grasp of backend development, especially using FastAPI, and enjoy building robust and efficient APIs.

📚 My next big goal is to dive deep into machine learning, master it, and work on exciting ML projects that can make a difference.

🚀 Always eager to learn new things, collaborate on innovative projects, and connect with like-minded individuals!
